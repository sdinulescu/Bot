\f0\fs24 \cf0 There's nothing to tell! He's just some guy I work with!\
C'mon, you're going out with the guy! There's gotta be something wrong with him!\
Alright Joey, be nice. So does he have a hump? A hump and a hairpiece?\
Wait, does he eat chalk?\
Just, 'cause, I don't want her to go through what I went through with Carl- oh!\
Okay, everybody relax. This is not even a date. It's just two people going out to dinner and not having sex.\
Sounds like a date to me.\
Alright, so I'm back in high school, I'm standing in the middle of the cafeteria, and I realize I am totally naked.\
Oh, yeah. Had that dream.\
Then I look down, and I realize there's a phone... there.\
Instead of...?\
That's right.\
Never had that dream.\
No.\
All of a sudden, the phone starts to ring. Now I don't know what to do, everybody starts looking at me.\
And they weren't looking at you before?!\
Finally, I figure I'd better answer it, and it turns out it's my mother, which is very very weird, because- she never calls me!\
Hi.\
This guy says hello, I wanna kill myself.\
Are you okay, sweetie?\
I just feel like someone reached down my throat, grabbed my small intestine, pulled it out of my mouth and tied it around my neck...\
Cookie?\
Carol moved her stuff out today.\
Ohh.\
Let me get you some coffee.\
Thanks.\
Ooh! Oh!\
No, no don't! Stop cleansing my aura! No, just leave my aura alone, okay?\
Fine! Be murky!\
I'll be fine, alright? Really, everyone. I hope she'll be very happy.\
No you don't.\
No I don't, to hell with her, she left me!\
And you never knew she was a lesbian...\
No! Okay?! Why does everyone keep fixating on that? She didn't know, how should I know?\
Sometimes I wish I was a lesbian... Did I say that out loud?\
I told mom and dad last night, they seemed to take it pretty well.\
Oh really, so that hysterical phone call I got from a woman at sobbing 3:00 A.M., I'll never have grandchildren, I'll never have grandchildren. was what? A wrong number?\
Sorry.\
Alright Ross, look. You're feeling a lot of pain right now. You're angry. You're hurting. Can I tell you what the answer is?\
Strip joint! C'mon, you're single! Have some hormones!\
I don't want to be single, okay? I just... I just I just wanna be married again!\
And I just want a million dollars!\
Rachel?!\
Oh God Monica hi! Thank God! I just went to your building and you weren't there and then this guy with a big hammer said you might be here and you are, you are!\
Can I get you some coffee?\
De-caff. Okay, everybody, this is Rachel, another Lincoln High survivor. This is everybody, this is Chandler, and Phoebe, and Joey, and you remember my brother Ross?\
Hi, sure!\
Hi.\
So you wanna tell us now, or are we waiting for four wet bridesmaids?\
Oh God... well, it started about a half hour before the wedding. I was in the room where we were keeping all the presents, and I was looking at this gravy boat. This really gorgeous Lamauge gravy boat. When all of a sudden- Sweet 'n' Lo?- I realized that I was more turned on by this gravy boat than by Barry! And then I got really freaked out, and that's when it hit me: how much Barry looks like Mr. Potato Head. Y'know, I mean, I always knew looked familiar, but... Anyway, I just had to get out of there, and I started wondering 'Why am I doing this, and who am I doing this for?'. So anyway I just didn't know where to go, and I know that you and I have kinda drifted apart, but you're the only person I knew who lived here in the city.\
Who wasn't invited to the wedding.\
Ooh, I was kinda hoping that wouldn't be an issue...\
Now I'm guessing that he bought her the big pipe organ, and she's really not happy about it.\
Tuna or egg salad? Decide!\
I'll have whatever Christine is having.\
Daddy, I just... I can't marry him! I'm sorry. I just don't love him. Well, it matters to me!\
If I let go of my hair, my head will fall off.\
Ooh, she should not be wearing those pants.\
I say push her down the stairs.\
Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs! Push her down the stairs!\
C'mon Daddy, listen to me! It's like, it's like, all of my life, everyone has always told me, 'You're a shoe! You're a shoe, you're a shoe, you're a shoe!'. And today I just stopped and I said, 'What if I don't wanna be a shoe? What if I wanna be a- a purse, y'know? Or a- or a hat! No, I'm not saying I want you to buy me a hat, I'm saying I am a ha- It's a metaphor, Daddy!\
You can see where he'd have trouble.\
Look Daddy, it's my life. Well maybe I'll just stay here with Monica.\
Well, I guess we've established who's staying here with Monica...\
Well, maybe that's my decision. Well, maybe I don't need your money. Wait! Wait, I said maybe!\
Just breathe, breathe.. that's it. Just try to think of nice calm things...\
Raindrops on roses and rabbits and kittens, bluebells and sleighbells and something with mittens... La la la la...something and noodles with string. These are a few...\
I'm all better now.\
I helped!\
Okay, look, this is probably for the best, y'know? Independence. Taking control of your life. The whole, 'hat' thing.\
And hey, you need anything, you can always come to Joey. Me and Chandler live across the hall. And he's away a lot.\
Joey, stop hitting on her! It's her wedding day!\
What, like there's a rule or something?\
Please don't do that again, it's a horrible sound.\
It's, uh, it's Paul.\
Oh God, is it 6:30? Buzz him in!\
Who's Paul?\
Paul the Wine Guy, Paul?\
Maybe. Joey: Wait. Your 'not a real date' tonight is with Paul the Wine Guy?\
He finally asked you out?\
Yes!\
Ooh, this is a Dear Diary moment.\
Rach, wait, I can cancel...\
Please, no, go, that'd be fine!\
Are, are you okay? I mean, do you want me to stay?\
That'd be good...\
Really?\
No, go on! It's Paul the Wine Guy!\
What does that mean? Does he sell it, drink it, or just complain a lot?\
Hi, come in! Paul, this is... everybody, everybody, this is Paul.\
Hey! Paul! Hi! The Wine Guy! Hey!\
I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name. Paul, was it?\
Okay, umm-umm, I'll just -I'll be right back, I just gotta go ah, go ah...\
A wandering?\
Change! Okay, sit down. Two seconds.\
Ooh, I just pulled out four eyelashes. That can't be good.\
Hey, Paul!\
Yeah?\
Here's a little tip, she really likes it when you rub her neck in the same spot over and over and over again until it starts to get a little red.\
Shut up, Joey!\
So Rachel, what're you, uh... what're you up to tonight?\
Well, I was kinda supposed to be headed for Aruba on my honeymoon, so nothing!\
Right, you're not even getting your honeymoon, God.. No, no, although, Aruba, this time of year... talk about your- -big lizards... Anyway, if you don't feel like being alone tonight, Joey and Chandler are coming over to help me put together my new furniture.\
Yes, and we're very excited about it.\
Well actually thanks, but I think I'm just gonna hang out here tonight. It's been kinda a long day.\
Okay, sure.\
Hey Pheebs, you wanna help?\
Oh, I wish I could, but I don't want to.\
Love is sweet as summer showers, love is a wondrous work of art, but your love oh your love, your love...is like a giant pigeon...crapping on my heart. la la la- Thank you. la la la...ohhh!\
I'm supposed to attach a brackety thing to the side things, using a bunch of these little worm guys. I have no brackety thing, I see no whim guys whatsoever and I cannot feel my legs.}
